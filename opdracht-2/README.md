### Functional, Usable & Pleasurable

### Color & Contrast
When I had the finished the basic HTML structure and CSS styling I decided to test the colors I had choosen on their contrast ratings:

My primary green color didn't score to well in the test. Because the color would be both a heading and interface element I made it darker so it would get at least a score of 3.

![Yellow](https://i.imgur.com/sfXGHIF.png)
Yellow also didn't score to good but this is an interesting case.

![Orange](https://i.imgur.com/n0PLfE2.png)
And the same goes for orange. So here I also darkend the color.

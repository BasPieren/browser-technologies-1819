# Opdracht 1.2 üèÉüèª
Here I explain the all the tested features and what I did or would do to fix it.

## Features
This is a list of all the features I have tested:

1. __Turn off images__
  - With out images my web app still works pretty good. The layout keeps its structure. The only thing missing is an alt text on some images.
2. __Turn off custom fonts__
  - *No custom fonts are used.*
3. __Turn off color & set color blindness__
  - Color blindness is not a huge problem in my web app. Contrast is still high enough to be able to read the text.
4. __Turn off mouse/trackpad__
  - The web app is still useable with a mouse and keyboard. The only problem is that the user can't reach the section with recommended books.
5. __Turn off broadband internet__
  - When the web app is tested on a slow 3G connection loading takes about 12 seconds when not counting in the API request and 48(!) seconds when including the API request.
6. __Turn off Javascript__
  - When Javascript is turnt off the whole web app stops working and is empty except for the header. This is because all content gets generated by Javascript.
7. __Turn off cookies__
  - *No cookies are used.*
8. __Turn off localStorage__
  - When localStorage is disabled the recommended books and agenda items are not shown.

## Device Lab & Screenreader Test
Here I describe the results from the device lab and screenreader tests.

### Device Lab
-

### Screenreader
To test the screenreader I used the ChromeVox extension for Goolge Chrome. I started tabbing through the web app And it worked ok. When ever I tab trough the web app the focus switches between the different `<a>` tags on the page and the screenreader reads the text inside each button. The problem is that the user is missing the context of what the button does.

## Problems
This is a list of problems I want to do in fix:

- [x] Add alt text to all images.
- [ ] Make the web app usable without mouse or trackpad.
- [ ] Make the web app usable without `localStorage`
  * To make the web app usable without `localStorage` the web app needs to be able to make an new API request when there is no `localStorage`.
